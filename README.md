Based on code samples provided here: https://github.com/Sage/sageone_api_php_sample


An integration with the Sage One api (v1) for WooCommerce - allowing orders to be turned into Sage One invoices at the click of a button (per order). One invoice will be created per order per month. Each invoice will be allocated a fraction of the total cost of the order, according to how many lessons occur in that month.
